# Adopt Don't Shop README

Welcome to Adopt Don't Shop, a web app project built on Rails as part of the curriculum for the Flatiron School.

## Ruby version

The Ruby version used is 2.3.3p222.

## System dependencies

## Usage

The purposed of this site (and my eventual hope for it) is to encourage the adoption of animals from shelters instead of purchasing pets from breeders. With the overwhelming number of animals awaiting adoption, many are euthanized (if they are not held in no-kill shelters), something that will only happen with more frequency unless people seeking pets opt to adopt from these shelters instead of seeking out breeders.

## Configuration and Installation

To view on a local environment, enter the following commands into terminal:
  $ git clone git@github.com:saurookadook/adopt-dont-shop-rails-app.git
  $ cd adopt-dont-shop-rails-app
  $ bundle install
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake db:seed
  $ rails s
