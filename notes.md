Marie Input:
  - 1.    Under "Adopters", I like what your trying to do, but I think for privacy reasons, you should remove emails and address. Give the option to create an account, and the person can then upload photos of their animals? More like an album. Create an option to "Contact Adopter" so that way personal information isn't on the web site.
  - 2.    How are you choosing which shelters on your website? Arbitrary or based off the users you have? You could consider highlighting certain shelters - since below the photo of Grandma is pretty sparse. Long term - you could make it a monthly highlight feature?
  - 3.    Links - you already said, some don't work.
  - 4.    Color - the green is a bit harsh and also looks just like the website of a humanoid reptile conspiracy theorist. I would suggest more aqua/teal/less bold colors.
  - 5.    Design -A little sparse on the front page, and the font you're using is pretty basic. If you like the san serif - I suggest something like Futura Light.
  - 6.    Photo - while grandma is totally adorable, the photo (on a desktop) is a bit grainy. Try to get use a photo of her in natural light. Also don't be afraid to crop the photo the way it looks best, don't try to necessarily fit in to the page as your parameters.
  - 7. If this is a website that will go live eventually, you should consider reaching out to shelters to see if they would put links on their sites, to create multi directional web traffic.

Mattie Input:
  - On home page, should just have pictures right there to see the dogs
  - Put a label about the dogs listings to give it a header so you know its dogs. I saw killer and was like wtf? Say “MEET OUR DOGS” or some shit
